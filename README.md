# Smart Mirror

## Setup, starting and stopping

### Initial setup

This repo includes a script to download and run the newest "release" (it's more like a **nightly** build of the `main` branch currently) automatically.

You would need

- 64bit system e.g. Raspberry Pi 4
- `ssh`, `git` and `docker` installed and setup
- a GitHub account with your ssh key connected

---

Than you simply

1. clone this repo
1. make `get-release.sh` executable (`chmod +x get-release.sh`)
1. run `get-release.sh`
1. smart-mirror container will be created and expose `http://[HOSTNAME/IP]`

### Updates

Should be as simple as running `get-release.sh` again. It will download a new version, remove old docker images and rebuild a new container from the new image.

### Some helpful commands (for me mostly ðŸ˜‚)
